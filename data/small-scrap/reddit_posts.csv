investing,"IMF Confirms China's Real Deficit Is 13.2%, Not the 3% Beijing Claims",109,1lmh8uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lmh8uc/imf_confirms_chinas_real_deficit_is_132_not_the_3/,54,2025-06-28 09:48:26,"China’s true deficit isn’t 3%. It’s 13.2%. And it’s been that high for over a decade.

Buried in the IMF’s 2024 Article IV report is the augmented deficit, there effort to reflect China’s *actual* fiscal position by including hidden off-budget borrowing, mainly through local government financing vehicles (LGFVs). The number? 13.2% of GDP in 2024.

That’s on par with the U.S. deficit at the height of COVID (15% in 2020), almost double the very high \~7% the U.S. runs today. But China’s been quietly running deficits at this level every year for over a decade.

The IMF created this metric because China’s official figures ignore quasi-fiscal activity by local governments. These borrowings fund a wide range of public goods such as infrastructure, transport, housing, utilities,etc - but are labeled as “corporate debt,” so they don’t show up in the national budget. The augmented deficit adjusts for this and puts China on an apples-to-apples footing with OECD fiscal reporting, where this kind of spending is always captured.

# The Proof:

* [IMF 2024 Article IV](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2024/08/01/Peoples-Republic-of-China-2024-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-552803): 13.2% augmented deficit explicitly stated on page 3.
* [Bank of Finland](https://www.bofit.fi/en/monitoring/weekly/2024/vw202408_1/) (April 2024): 13% deficit for 2024, expecting 14%+ in 2025.
* [The Economist in 2016](https://archive.is/toxIg): Cited IMF data showing \~10% deficit driven by LGFV borrowing post-2008
* [2013 IMF (David Lipton):](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/54/tr052913) Deputy Managing Director stated China's true deficit was ""In the order of 10% of GDP"" once off-budget activity included.
* [LGFV debt has quintupled since 2012: ](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2024/china-navigates-debt-restructuring-ahead-of-trump-20/)From 13.5 trillion to 70 trillion yuan
* [Peterson Institute (March 2024)](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2024/chinas-official-deficit-no-longer-meaningful-measure-its-budget-system): ""China's official deficit is no longer a meaningful measure""

# Other interesting items from IMF report...

* China's augmented public debt was actually 124% of GDP in 2024, eclipsing [US levels of 120%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEGDQ188S).
* Projected GDP growth in 2029: 3.3% with the deficit still 12.2%
* Fiscal revenues peaked in 2021 and are now declining, unprecedented for a major economy. For reference, U.S. federal revenues expected to grow abou[t 60% by 2035.](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-01/60870-By-the-Numbers.pdf)

To be clear, this isn’t hidden data. China openly reports its Total Social Financing, which captures this borrowing (though it’s disguised as “corporate”). And the IMF publicly publishes the augmented numbers. they’re just buried in footnotes.

No idea what to do with this information. "

But you need a good amount of cash temporarily ( 1-3 months for an emergency/investment opportunity) you are still earning and will be actively paying down or able to get financing to get the cash back and pay down the margin

What are some good guidelines to follow in terms of a safe amount of margin to take out in relation to overall portfolio? And ways to hedge to avoid margin calls if you were to need more? 

Seems to me a small amount let’s say 5-15% of the portfolio would be safe in most situations as long as you’re diversified. But getting higher than a certain percentage starts getting much more risky and using some type of hedge like options for that 1-3 months would be needed.

Assume the holding period is 3 years during a declining rate environment.

So you buy a 10 year Treasury Bond.

Your interest payment is the same every time.

As rates decline, the bond price appreciates.

I know (or think) there's no actual 10-year-only Treasury ETF, but say there was.  Pays monthly.

The ETF has portfolio turnover, so as rates decline the monthly div declines.

The price should appreciate, but because of the effect of turnover, it won't match the appreciation of the single bond.

Is that correct?  Do you inevitably give up some return by owning the ETF instead of the bond itself?

**Pre-editing to add:** OK one flaw in my question is that the ETF portfolio has stuff that's older than any single recent interest rate trend.  So pretend you managed to top-tick rates for the next 3 years on the day you bought the bond or ETF."

I’m planning to invest €1,000 per month into the S&P and let it grow over time.

Is there any Chance that I will end up with more money when I have a horizon for 3-5 years? Or is it for at least 10 years?

investing,"The stock jumped 280%, so I bought right away !!  Big mistake. Speculative Bubbles: The Troubling Case of Regencell Bioscience",0,1lmjk0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lmjk0r/the_stock_jumped_280_so_i_bought_right_away_big/,2,2025-06-28 12:25:40,"**I’m writing this post as a warning to both beginners and seasoned investors: don’t fall for the “You Only Live Once” mindset.**

Lately, if you’ve been following the market, you’ve probably seen or heard of companies skyrocketing by over 1000% in just a few weeks or months   Regencell (RGC) being a prime example.

Using our screening tools, we noticed that **Regencell Bioscience (RGC)** surged more than **280%** right after its **38-for-1 reverse stock split** came into effect in early June 2025. Naturally, it’s tempting to jump in and buy — who wouldn’t be?

But here’s the catch: **it’s all smoke and mirrors.**

Dig a little deeper and here’s what you’ll find:

* **Regencell Bioscience**, based in Hong Kong and listed on the Nasdaq, **has no revenue**, **no marketed products**, **no regulatory approvals**, and **no patents**.
* They reported **net losses of $4.4 million in 2024** and **$6.1 million in 2023**, according to their filings.
* Their **Chief Medical Officer position has been vacant since 2022** — yes, you read that right, **since 2022**!

Even more alarming:

* Only **about 6% of the company’s shares are publicly tradable**. The CEO, **Yat-Gai Au**, owns **86% of the shares**, making the stock extremely volatile and easy to manipulate.
* Out of **500 million shares**, only **30 million are available** on the market.

The company’s “science” is based on **traditional herbal formulas** developed by the CEO’s father, with **no peer-reviewed publications** and **only internal trials**.

Now you might ask, *“But what’s the harm in taking the risk?”*

Here’s the real issue:  
The **Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)** — the watchdog for U.S. brokers — has repeatedly warned that **low-priced small-cap stocks are especially vulnerable to fraud**, including **pump-and-dump schemes**. These often involve hyped-up events like a stock split, used to lure in retail investors before insiders sell off their shares at inflated prices.

In **June 2025**, FINRA also moved to **redefine “foreign private issuers”**, potentially stripping some companies of the special status that allows them to avoid filing regular financial reports or disclosing insider trades.

So, before you invest in a **penny stock**, **do your research**. It may take time, but it could **save your money**  and your **ears** (when your partner screams at you for losing it ;)  lol.. ).

I hope this post will help some people think twice before jumping immediately on a stock and making a mistake.

What in your opinion is the best way to handle the foreign exchange rate risk if your investments primarily take place in the foreign country (in this case US)?

Are there any approaches you have read about in popular books/articles?

As far as I see it, there are the following options:

1) Keep investing as before and dont exit positions when unfavorable fx rates (exchange rates go up and down, so eventually it will come around again, and then consider exiting your positions?)  
2) Move into other markets when risk is high (when would i consider the risk to be high though...? i wouldnt expect myself or any hobby investor to make reliable calls on how the exchange rates will evolve)  
3) Hedge your positions (if so, how? hedged etf for example or actual futures, etc.?)

I’m not very savvy at this but I understand most of the basics. If it matters I’m 36y old and I’ll try and be simple.

Right now I have a traditional IRA in State Farm and SoFi. The reason for this split is a family member who works for SF wanted me to bring all my money there but instead I did half and half just to see if there was any big performance. I do NOT contribute to the traditional IRAs at all. It’s hardly grown.

I also have a SoFi Roth IRA that I do contribute to twice a month that has been set to a “moderately aggressive” strategy and has gained (if I’m reading this correctly) 13% in a year or 37% since account opening. This, I do contribute to twice a month. 

My dilemma. I had a guy from Primerica show me what would have happened if I invested in Invesco by splitting up my contributions into different funds. He showed me that in the last two years alone Invesco’s “American Franchise Fund” had a calendar return of 40% (2023) and 34% (2024). And I don’t really know what all that means even after we sat here to talk about it. LOL I feel like if I went to ANY company, of course they’d try to show me their best performance to get me to sign up. SoFi, Capital One, whomever would try and convince me. 

My questions. 
Does that mean that if I had my money in Invesco it would’ve grown 70% in the last two years? He made it seem like Invesco was substantially better than SoFi.
Specifically Between Invesco and SoFi which would you prefer and why? 
Or any other company you’d recommend I look into for retirement?
What should I look for when investing? I had it once in Capital One but moved to SoFi because it had better returns. 

I understand completely that past performance isn’t indicative to what my actual return would be in the future. This is all nonsense to me lol and I can barely keep up.

EDIT: just to add to this, the guy who owns this business also contacts my friend regularly and sets up video conferences with those who invested to update them on their investment growth  so hes doing the most to make it seem legit

CONTEXT:

Long story short, my friend along with a bunch of other regular people (not rich, not business owners, just individuals who want to invest a small amount of money) got invited to this opportunity to invest in this company called ""triple bet"" you can google it and find the site

My friend received a pitch, the entire investment plan/blueprint, WHY to invest and how much growth is anticipated.

The ""owner"" of this company claimed that this is a legit, protected investment and even had them sign ""legal documents"" to protect themselves in this investment.

The owner invited this group to his house (some huge mansion in Drake'es area) then explained that this gambling software its in its early stages and already has other investors putting millions of dollars into it. He needed a few people to pitch in $5k USD each and in return they get a share of this company and will earn a huge return of money when this blows up.

My friend is now relying on this investment and truly believes he'll turn $5k int over $100k or even more. He thinks its going to blow up and be huge cause gambling is a billion dollar industry.

I really am skeptical and i dont at all think its legit or realistic to get such a huge return.

I told my friend not to put all his eggs in one basket and just wait for one investment to blow up cause it may not even be legit.

Has anyone ever invested in a gambling product like this that yielded such a large return? Im truly not the most financially literate but this just doesnt seem legit to me and im worried he put his $5k into a scam

AND if this is a scam - how could this guy arrange for people to just come into his mansion like that and show his cars and idk how he couldve thought this out so far without being afraid of getting the cops called to his house or something once people realize its a scam"

My dad and I just bout a rental using a 379k margin loan, backed by a $677k portfolio. about $500k of that is in JPST, a short-term bond ETF we're using as a stable base. 

  
The margin rate is 5.25% in year 1, then 6.25% in year 2. for comparison the lowest mortgage rate we could find was 6.99.

the rent covers the interest and gives enough cash flow to pay off the loan over 30years. 

  
we did this to:

* avoid selling stocks and triggering capital gains 
* keep upside exposure in the portfolio
* lock in a property that cash flows

Just curious what others think:

* is this a smart use of leverage, or are we taking on unnecessary risk?
* is JPST a good base for this kind of setup, or too conservative?
* Would you have done anything differently?

Would really appreciate any honest takes - good, bad, or ""wtf are you doing?"""

I have a financial advisor (one of my old friends). We reviewed my IRA account and made a few changes. 

Now, I know there are fees associated with this. But I want to assess my situation and see if it's the best option.

Right now, I do $7000 a year in a Roth (possible chance of back-door depending on my yearly AGI - it's targeting right around the number. If the back-door IRA matters in this situation.

We changed my portfolio into two mutual funds - X and Y. Here are the fees associated on the prospectus:

Operating fees = 0.58%  
Maximum sales charge = 5.75%  
\-Y:  
Operating fees = 0.58%  
Maximum sales charge = 5.75% 

So, I'm very new so excuse me being naive, this means that of the $7,000 per year, only $6113 is being invested? The other $886 goes to them? MATH: (7000 \* 12.6%)

  
What the fuck? Is this normal for a mutual fund?

  
NOW, I have a taxable portfolio in Robinhood as well. Various Index funds and stocks, with a splash of crypto. If I use Robinhood's Roth IRA, would these fees be significantly lower? I'm a little lost right now. He's been a good friend for 15+ years (middle school tennis, college, fraternity). I know he's looking out for me, but at the same time he represents a company that seeks to make money. Is this just the way these services are? Am I truly better off doing my own Roth IRA with Robinhood? Yes, I'll lose access to the mutual fund, but honestly if I just load it into other various index funds, I'm sure performance would be roughly similar.

I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.

So two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\~8% return for the rest of my life.

After this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.

PS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than ""find a strategy"" or ""just buy and hold spy"" kind of stuff. I am still open to this advice but I need more psychological aspect of it."

I have multiple brokerage accounts (Fidelity, Schwab, Etrade) and up until now have been holding MFs that each brokerage offered (Due to no load/transaction fees, etc.) but with ETS w/ very similar holdings/returns I have to wonder if the management these ETFs do is any different than the ETF which do also manage their holdings (Sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly).  I like the benefit of being able to liquidate an asset at any point (Rather than waiting until after close w/ a MF) as well as the fact that I have the funds available to use instantly w/ an ETF sale.  Each of these tracks a different market so I'd be curious on your opinions on that as well. Perhaps it's best to stick w/ what I have diversify what markets are tracked?  If I do this, I need to research international Large blend ETFs but I'd be curious of your opinions on International large blend or growth ETFs w/ low expense ratios (<.04%).

Examples

**Current Schwab  MF holdings:** (Considering moving SWPPX at a minimum to SCHG)   
SWISX    .06%  Tracks the MSCI EAFE Index  
SWPPX   .02%  Tracks the S&P 500 (1/3rd in tech)  
SWLGX   .035% (48% tech ) Tracks the Russel 1000 Growth index

  
**Considering**:  
SCHG  .04% (48% tech and VERY similar top 10 holdings to SWLGX) Tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index vs. Russel 1000 Growth index

  
**Current Fidelity**  
FXAIX .015%  Tracks the S&P 500 (1/3rd in tech)  
FSPGX .035% (47% tech) Tracks the Russel 1000 Growth index

**Considering**:  
SCHG  .04% (48% tech and VERY similar top 10 holdings to SWLGX) Tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index vs. Russel 1000 Growth index

  
So basically I would be moving at least FSPGZ and SWLGX tracking from the Russel 1000 growth index to S&P 500 index.  Not sure if there is any benefit to that aside from the fact I could move the funds much quicker if need be.  I also like the real-time stats I see on an ETF vs. a MF.  Petty and insignificant, I know.

I'm 30F from the Philippines. I came to Taiwan carrying nothing but emotional pain from growing up with an absent father. I have four younger siblings who are still enduring the same emotional struggles back home, and I really wanted to save them.

I arrived in Taiwan with 0 nada in my pocket. But after two years of studying and working part-time jobs, I managed to save USD 4,000. It might not seem like much, but to me, it's the beginning of something bigger.

Now, I'm determined to use this money wisely. My goal is to prove to myself and my father that I can rise from nothing, and build a future that’s not only stable, but abundant. I want to be rich and give my siblings the financial security they never had. 

I apologize if I shared a bit too much information.  But, I was hoping I could find a mentor or financial advisor who might be willing to guide me likd where to start and how to make the most of what I have, and so on. I figured it’s only proper to share a bit of my background and motivations. Hehe thank you so much. 🥹🥹🥹

The key idea is this: the illusion of stability in Chinese corporate bonds hides a convex risk profile; low defaults now, but huge damage when stress hits.

What have I discovered? Off-balance-sheet loans, state-controlled bailouts, and opacity in the shadow banking system.

And probably when the crisis comes, it will not be gradual, but violent.

My presumption it that the company does the split to raise the stock price to avoid being delisted then issues new stock at the higher stock price to gain additional funding without the need for loans.

investing,Has anyone back tested a strategy of tracking towards goal yearly with any surplus gains going into a steady investment?,0,1lk5hil,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lk5hil/has_anyone_back_tested_a_strategy_of_tracking/,1,2025-06-25 15:20:00,"Ik there are back testing tools but not really good with them yet and can’t get to exactly this. Never heard of this so guessing results are not very good but curious what this would look like. 

The parameters are basically this:

You are 30 with a goal of retiring by 67 with a goal of hitting $1M in todays $. You calculate $7000 per year (max IRA, goes up roughly with inflation so easy to track) with 6.5% real return gets you to that goal.

The problem is while 6.5% is pretty average year to year, decade to decade, returns swing pretty wildly and the timing of these swings greatly impact performance even if the return is 6.5% over this time. For example really strong early performance when you don’t have much in with much worse performance later when you have a lot in could in total have 6.5% returns but you’d fall short. 

To manage this the portfolio is reallocated at end of every year to smooth this out and increase certainty the goal is hit. 

For example in year 1 there was 2% inflation. With the target of 6.5% real return the goal should be to have $7k grow to $7,595 plus max ira contribution that hopefully tracked roughly with inflation. The market nominally returned 15% though and portfolio stands at $8050. You are $455 above target. In this scenario you move $455 to safe investment that tracks inflation. 

Continue this over and over. Your portfolio in stocks is on target to hit your goal while having surplus in cash. Whenever downswing hits that takes you under target you move cash to equity til it brings you back to target. Anytime you are short of target with no cash you stay 100% equity. 

How would this have played out historically? "

You give them $100, they issue you 100 USD stablecoins. They invest your $100 in short-term treasuries and pocket the interest. When you redeem, they return your $100, burn those stablecoins, and pocket the interest earned. That is the entire model: mint, invest, burn, repeat.

Their whole business depends on earning interest from user deposits.

  
4 major issues:

1. Competition is about to explode. Stablecoins are multiplying fast, and once the GENIUS Act passes, every bank will be rolling out its own. There is no reason a bank would let Circle make interest on customer deposits when they could issue their own stablecoin and keep those profits themselves.

2. Interest margins are already under pressure. Other issuers are starting to return more of that yield directly to users. Some are giving back nearly all of it to win customers over. Stablecoins have become an adoption tactic, not a sustainable cash cow. Circle will eventually have to share more of that interest just to keep customers around, killing its profits.

They are also completely exposed to interest rates. Higher rates help Circle earn more. When rates fall, so does their revenue. Powell will cut rates eventually, and Circle has no other meaningful revenue streams to cushion the hit.

3. The valuation is hard to justify

They peaked at $20 billion, crashed to $5 billion pre-IPO, and somehow bounced back to $46 billion. They made $1.45 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2024, which is a 28x revenue multiple. Half of that revenue comes through a partner, Coinbase, that is already sharing yield with its customers. For Circle to even get near $10 billion in revenue, the entire stablecoin market would need to grow 7x, assuming no competition.

There is no moat, no pricing power, no differentiation. Competitors will squeeze Circle until there is nothing left, and customers will chase whoever gives them more yield.

4. Only around 11% - 18% of the stock is in the public float, with a 180-day lockup. Once that expires, insiders will be ready to dump.

This is going back to 50 very soon.

If no trade deals get done (and let’s be honest, the EU isn’t exactly sprinting), we could see tariffs ramp back up to 25%+ on imports from major partners.

Analysts are saying it’s 50/50 whether the White House extends the pause, does partial deals, or lets the hammer drop. If tariffs hit, inflation could tick up again, and the Fed might stall rate cuts. Markets aren’t exactly priced for that.

What’s the move here?
	•	Go short on cyclicals?
	•	Load up on volatility plays (UVXY, VIX calls)?
	•	Rotation into gold, defense stocks, or straight-up cash?
	•	Or is this all priced in already and we’re overthinking it?

**Background**

$SANA has technology that they use to modify lab-grown cells so that the cells are not rejected (killed) when transplanted into a patient. The genetically modified cells are referred to as ""immune evasive"" cells. As a proof of concept, $SANA modified donor pancreatic islets (islets are cells that regulate blood sugar and produce insulin) so that the donor pancreatic islets would be immune evasive and could be implanted into a human recipient patient without being rejected. One patient was implanted with these immune evasive islets by $SANA on Dec. 2, 2024. The patient did not need to take immunosuppression after receiving the immune evasive donor pancreatic islets in order for the transplanted islets to survive (normally donor islets are rejected/killed within a couple weeks).

6 month data from the Dec. 2 transplant was just released this past Monday (June 23, 2025) and revealed that the transplanted immune evasive pancreatic islet cells were still alive and functional (producing insulin), eliminating any doubt that $SANA's tech will enable lab-grown cells to survive long-term in patients ([source](https://ir.sana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sana-biotechnology-announces-positive-six-month-clinical-results)). This is the FIRST AND ONLY TIME that human IMMUNE EVASIVE CELLS have been transplanted and demonstrated to SURVIVE LONG TERM in a HUMAN. In other words, $SANA now owns unique technology that will be vital for not just enabling a type 1 diabetes cure (the survival of transplanted lab-grown pancreatic islets), but any therapy or cure that involves avoiding rejection while transplanting lab-grown cells or tissues into a patient.

**What's next for $SANA?**

$SANA's initial transplant study in 1 patient used pancreatic islets from a deceased donor. Obviously, this is not a scalable source of the pancreatic islets needed to cure type 1 diabetes. $SANA recognized this and has already produced pancreatic islets from stem cells that are immune evasive. They have a master stem cell line with the immune evasive edits (that is now very well characterized to avoid unwanted mutations) that they can use to grow as many pancreatic islets as they want in the lab from scratch. These are referred to as ""stem cell derived islets"". Scientists are very good at growing functional islets from stem cells in the lab now, so this is not a problem that $SANA has to worry about. The islets they can produce from their immune evasive stem cell line are functional enough to cure type 1 diabetes. A recent ongoing trial from another company, Vertex, demonstrated that stem cell derived islets can be used to cure type 1 diabetes ([source](https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-presents-positive-data-zimislecel-type-1-diabetes)); however, critically, Vertex has no solution for the rejection problem and the patients in their study had to take immunosuppressants to avoid rejecting the stem cell derived islets. 1 of the 14 initial patients in Vertex's study died due to being on the immunosuppressants (which severely weakens a patients immune system, making them vulnerable to simple infections). The patient died from a fungal infection known to affect people on immunosuppression and that people with healthy immune systems would have normally avoided ([source](https://www.thejdca.org/publications/report-library/archived-reports/2024-reports/vertex-t1d-trial-moves-into-phase-iii.html#:~:text=On%20the%20other%20hand%2C%20patients,heavy%20risk%20of%20broad%20immunosuppression))

$SANA has now made immune evasive stem cell derived islets which are known to be functional enough to cure type 1 diabetes. Vertex's trial, which relied on deadly immunosuppression, confirms beyond any doubt that stem cell derived islets can cure type 1 diabetes. Considering $SANA's recent 6 month data in the first human patient transplanted with immune evasive islets, it is now essentially known that $SANA's immune evasive stem cell derived islets will last long term in patients without immunosuppression, since they use the same immune evasive tehcnology that worked in the first human patient. Thus, all that remains at this point is for $SANA to start human trials with their immune evasive stem cell derived islets. Sure, they have to go through the trials, but  the current evidence overwhelmingly indicates that $SANA's immune evasive stem cell derived islets will be successful.

**Competition**

$SANA is light years ahead of any potential competition. They are the only company with demonstrably successful long-term immune evasive technology. There are 2 other companies, Vertex and CRISPR, that claim to be working on immune evasive pancreatic islets; however, none of these 2 companies have demonstrated long-term working immune evasive technology. Moreover, they won't simply be able to copy $SANA's tech since it will violate their patents. In order to even compete with $SANA regarding immune evasive cells, Vertex and CRISPR have to come up with an alternative immune evasive technology that $SANA has not already patented and that demonstrably works in humans long-term. This is not a trivial feat. Both companies are severely behind $SANA. Both CRISPR and Vertex list their immune evasive islet therapies as ""research stage"" on their pipeline pages([source Vertex](https://www.vrtx.com/our-science/pipeline/type-1-diabetes/), [source CRISPR](https://crisprtx.com/pipeline)). In other words, they have no real chance of catching up to $SANA any time soon, and they may never.

While Vertex has transplanted stem cell derived islets into humans that cure type 1 diabetes, as mentioned above, the patients needed to be on immunosuppressant drugs to avoid rejection of the transplanted islets. 1 out of 14 patients died due to immunosuppression complications. This is a LETHAL FLAW in the Vertex approach. The tradeoff of curing type 1 diabetes, but permanently weakening your immune system and greatly increasing chance of death due to simple infections is simply unacceptable for nearly all type 1 diabetes patients.

**How much is a type 1 diabetes cure worth?**

Let's look at some statistics to get a ballpark idea to guide us in valuing a type 1 diabetes cure.

Approximate number of type 1 diabetics in United States: 1.5 million     Worldwide: 9.1 million  ([source](https://www.breakthrought1d.org/t1d-basics/incidence-prevalence/))

Average lifetime cost of type 1 diabetes per person in the United States is $500K ([source](https://www.breakthrought1d.org/news-and-updates/new-jdrf-funded-study-finds-lifetime-t1d-management-costs-a-collective-813-billion/)). Given that, a reasonable cost for a type 1 diabetes cure might be some number less than $500K. For the sake of coming up with some estimate, let's assume that $SANA charges $100K for their type 1 diabetes cure (it could be more or it could be less).

Assume cost of type 1 diabetes cure is $100K:

$100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 1.5 million current U.S. patients = $150B U.S. revenue

$100K (assumed treatment cost)  \* 9.1 million current global patients = $910B global revenue

But what about new cases of type 1 diabetes each year?

About 52,000 people in the US and 503,000 people globally are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year ([source](https://www.breakthrought1d.org/t1d-basics/incidence-prevalence/)).

$100k (assumed treatment cost) \* 52K new U.S. patients = $5.2B new yearly U.S. revenue

$100k (assumed treatment cost) \* 503K new global patients = $50.3B new yearly global revenue

Again, these are just ballpark estimates, but the point is that a type 1 diabetes cure is a MASSIVE on the order of $100B to $1T opportunity. Certainly a company like $SANA, which has a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands is worth more than a measly $654M market cap, even factoring in things like potential dilution (more on that in a bit).

What's even more mind blowing is that $SANA's immune evasive tech unlocks all sorts of other currently impossible therapies. Any lab-grown cell or tissue therapy will need $SANA's proven immune evasive tech in order to work. Companies developing things like lab-grown liver tissue or blood vessels may license $SANA's immune evasive technology, or $SANA may simply develop the therapies themselves. Taken together, $SANA has the potential to grow into a massive company. A $1T valuation further down the line would not be out of the question if they play their cards right. The market opportunity they have is not just massive, but legnedary in size.

**Investor concerns (and why you shouldn't be concerned)**

At the moment, there are 2 main concerns that $SANA investors have:

1. $SANA is running out of cash. They only have 2-3 quarters of runway left. This is true; however, here's why you shouldn't be concerned. Quite simply, $SANA has monumentally good data, and a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands. As was just discussed above, the market opportunity is massive. So massive that investors will not let the company run out of money. Since the amount of money to be made is so large and the impact so great, someone will foot the bill to keep the lights on. It's just a question of who and how much they will invest. And what the investment will look like.

Some of the largest investors in $SANA are Arch Ventures and Flagship Pioneering, 2 of the world's largest biotech VC firms. Neither of these VCs has sold much of their initial stake and are likely underwater on their positions considering $SANA launched with $700M in funding (more reason to not anticipate too much dilution) ([source](https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/sana-biotechnology-unveils-700m-in-financing)). Jeff Bezo's fund Bezos Expeditions is also an original $SANA investor. It might be an extreme example, but Bezos could invest $1B in $SANA like it's nothing (he's given several $100M donations to various people in the past, why not help realize a type 1 diabetes cure?). The point is, there are wealthy people who want to see a type 1 diabetes cure realized (and/or make money off it) and together will be able to fund $SANA's continued operations, especially as long as there data is promising (and it is promising). $SANA will not go bankrupt, data and market opportunity is too good.

An interesting thought: Since you know $SANA has to raise money in the next 2-3 quarters, you can logically assume that a funding announcement will likely occur within 2-3 quarters. This is likely to be a positive catalyst as it will provide investors with clarity. As discussed in the next section, I don't expect significant dilution, which brings me to the next investor concern.

2. $SANA will be diluted significantly. It's true that common methods of raising more funding for a biotech running out of cash involve dilution, but there isn't reason to expect that $SANA would be diluted significantly if it raises dilutive funding. Consider again how great the market opportunity for $SANA to address is. It's reasonable to surmise that there are many, many investors that are clamoring to invest in $SANA now, but there is only a limited number of investors that they will be able to take on. What happens when a deal is competitive? A bidding war ensues and the valuation of the company increases. Investors are willing to put the same amount of money into a company for less of a percentage stake.

Basically, because $SANA is so promising, any dilutiion from fundraising is likely to be minimal. In cases where a biotech startup is in a danger of going bankrupt, but has questionable data, dilution can be massive (e.g. on the order of 90%), but $SANA is a complete opposite situation. They may only be diluted  10%. Or they may not be diluted at all if they pursue a partnership that provides upfront payments in exchange for something like royalties. In an extreme case, they may get a donation. Let's say they were diluted 50% (this seems unlikely to me), the valuation would now be around $1.3B instead of $650M (assuming the price stays the same and number of shares double). It would still be a ridiculously low valuation compared to the opportunity discussed above.

There are a large number of funding possibilities for $SANA and competition among investors is likely to be fierce. Vertex would be interested in $SANA tech, but so would Lilly (who makes insulin and whose business will suffer once a type 1 diabetes cure is available). This brings us to the next consideration. What could $SANA be acquired for?

**What's a reasonable acquisition price for $SANA? ($10B minimum)**

To get straight to the point, probably at least somewhere around $10B. $SANA is an extremely promising biotech and extremely promising biotechs have recently been acquired for around $10B. You can look in the news for several examples ([example](https://chatgpt.com/share/685d1b30-9238-8012-9898-6aed9151df12)), but you really don't need to look any further than Juno therapeutics, which was acquired for $9B in 2018 ([source](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/celgene-confirms-9bn-juno-buyout-sees-3bn-sales-for-jcar017)). Why do I highlight Juno therapeutics? Because many of Sana's leadership/founders are former Juno leaders/founders. In otherwords they are experienced and have been through an acquistion before. They know how to play the game. Frankly, I would think $SANA would be worth paying even more than $10B to acquire. Their market opportunity will go far beyond type 1 diabetes.

**Ok, I'm sold. How should I play $SANA? (not financial advice)**

Buy shares and hold. Just buy and hold as many shares as you can as long as the valuation is under $10B. And even at $10B valuation, they could potentially be an even more valuable company, so I'd probably keep holding a stake then too. I've been buying shares since the all time low and my most recent purchase was at $2.63 (as you can see in the first screenshot above). I don't think it really matters what price you get the shares at now. The stock, in my opinion, is ridiculously undervalued. Perhaps it was shorted as people worried about it going bankrupt or the tech not working or dilution, but as described above, I don't think those are real concerns.

As always, none of this is financial advice. Do your own due diligence. Hopefully this is some helpful DD to get you started."

The chart above shows how Google is now funneling record numbers of new traffic (and thus new users) to Reddit.

India is a huge country. It doubles U.S. user counts on both YouTube and Facebook. Yet India is less than one-third the size of US users on Reddit. The upside here is thus enormous. If you overlay India’s early search-traffic curve on the launch-to-date growth for France, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, India is clearly sprinting past every precedent.

The model I created on May 13 assumed France-style adoption rates (the yellow projection line). The latest Semrush data shows India blowing through that benchmark (the white dotted projection line).
